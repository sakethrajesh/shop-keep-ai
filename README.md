Goal​

Design a prototype and an intuitive navigation system for mobile application that displays ground tracks of space-based electro-optical sensors with an interactive map of the globe that allows to explore collection opportunities and fused data based on past collections.​

​

Object​

Clean and intuitive mobile application – think client, and device (ios, android) application – needs clarification​

Visualize commercial sensor details to include:  orbit, collections opportunities (past, current and future???) and data​

Data format consideration for EO, SAR, RF, COM, HSI, Fused???   ​

Fused data based past collection (temporal and geospatially)​

True fusion or Layering ??? ​

Leverage UXD (user experience design) methodology​

Leverage CI/CD (continuous integration, continuous development) approach​
